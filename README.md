## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Game idea:** I came up with an idea that I really liked. It took me a while to choose because I cared a lot about what I was going to do, but in the end I was happy with my decision. It was more fun to work on something I actually enjoyed.
- **Gameplay design:** I really enjoyed thinking and brainstorming new ideas on how to make the game more fun and challenging. Designing each level with the right difficulty was interesting. I wanted to add more features, like a final boss, but I didn’t have enough time.

### Challenges:
- **Drawing and designing:** Learning how to use a new pixel art program was difficult at first. Understanding the tools and actually drawing took time. I also struggled with designing the map, i wanted it to feel like a magical forest, so choosing the right colors was important. At the end, I decided to redesign the map and add more details like different grass tiles and flowers. Drawing the character was also challenging, so I chose a simpler and cuter style instead of something more complicated.
- **Bug Fixes:** Collision with objects and aligning the grid correctly with each tile was one of the harder technical problems.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Showing the game to others:** Showing my game to other people helped a lot. They noticed things I didn’t and suggested ideas that made the game look better and feel more complete. Even small changes made a big difference, so next time I would ask for feedback earlier and more often.
- **Keeping it simple:** The animations ended up being simple, but the gameplay became more engaging. I’m glad I chose to keep the animations simple because they take a lot of time, and I usually overthink them. This time I focused more on gameplay, which worked better for me.
